                <p> The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a method of sorting and categorizing different personalities, has become quite trendy these days - mostly on twitter - and even though this classification isn’t 100% accurate, it helps comprehending how one interacts with the outer world. However, it’s important to keep in mind that a person's personality tends to change throughout their life and there are many factors that can influentiate one’s feeling, action or way of thinking when facing a certain situation. That being said, the types of personality that will be presented in this article will certainly not give you a lifetime-systematic-way of how you or others will behave, but I personally consider it a great helper when it comes to understanding more about people. </p>

                <h3> A little bit of history </h3>
                    <p> The theory behind this indicator was developed by a swiss psychologist named Carl G. Jung, who proposed two main orientations - extroversion and introversion - and four basic functions - thinking, feeling, sensing and intuiting - that would compound one’s personality. On top of that, he suggested that people generally engage into one of two mental functions - perceiving or judging -, which became the fourth dichotomy later established by the researcher Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, the creators of the Myers Briggs Type Indicator. </p>
                <h3> What each letter stands for </h3>
                    <p> As previously mentioned, there are 16 types of personality and each one is comprised of four letters - or functions: </p>
                    <table id = "acronym">
                        <tr> 
                            <td class = "type"> E (extrovert) x I (introvert) </td>
                            <td class = "meaning"> your comfortable way of interacting with the outer world - especially people </td>
                        <tr>
                            <td class = "type"> S (sensing) x N (intuition) </td>
                            <td class = "meaning"> how you comprehend and process information around you </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class = "type"> T (thinking) x F (feeling) </td>
                            <td class = "meaning"> your way of making decisions </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class = "type"> J (judging) x P (perceiving) </td>
                            <td class = "meaning"> how you orientate and deal with your outer life </td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p> When combining your preferences in each category, you get an acronym - or your personality type: </p>

               <h3> More about personality types </h3>
                    <p> From what I’ve observed, people tend to stop right there - at comprehending what their type stands for - and only knowing one’s acronym and its letters’ meanings doesn’t give us the whole story. In other words, I’d say it’s important to also understand how those functions interact together: for example, an introverted-sensing type usually manifests their sensing differently than an extroverted-sensing type does; which means that the same function can look very different depending on one’s main orientation.  </p>
                    <p> However, I’ll not get into that, because there’s another theory behind that way of comprehending the 16 personalities - named Socionics - and this article’s main theme is the MBTI. Besides, it’s way more complex than the given indicator, despite both having the same basis - Carl Jung’s theory. Still, I find it worth taking a look at Socionics if you’re willing to understand more about your personality type and make the classification as accurate as possible, so you might want to take a look at that later. </p>

                <h3> Astrology and MBTI </h3>
                <p> After all that personality stuff, I can finally get to my point that astrology and MBTI are pretty alike nowadays - and unfortunately not in a good way. As previously mentioned, instead of the 12 zodiac signs, the Myers Briggs Indicator gives us 16 types in which people could be classified and - to no one’s surprise - with such classification some stereotypes have been built. So, there’s the problem: stereotypes. They don’t give us the whole story and frequently lead to presumptions or even misunderstandings.</p>
                <p> Well, I know this sounds pretty obvious, like “of course I wouldn’t presume shallow things about someone”, but we often do assume people’s characteristics, way of behaving or sayings, even when we know them; given that reason, I once more appeal for not taking categorizations as an universal truth, especially when it comes to people. In addition, I insist there’s no such thing as “the best personality type”, but I can assure you that are certain characteristics that can make, for example, one’s easier to talk to or not - and that’s ok, because it just means you’re different from another person or you two have things in common! </p>
                <p> In conclusion, when it comes to similar things to astrology and MBTI, I’d say they’re useful - to a certain extent - to understand others’ way of being and then accepting that some people are just the way they are (such a cliché, but it’s true). Also, my personal advice concerning personality classifications is: use them to think; not to assume things or put people in a box, but to think how people are, how their mindset influentiate their lives and how they deal with things. I assure you all this thinking process can be very helpful someday :) </p>
