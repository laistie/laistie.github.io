                            <p> The main purpose of this website is to develop my coding skills, although its content, as for now, won't be focused on formal projects; but if you want to check some of my university projects, you should take a look at my github profile, which is linked down below the socials section. </p>
                        <h2> <mark> about me </mark> </h2>
                            <p> I'm a 2nd semester undergraduate student at Universidade Estadual de Londrina (UEL). </p>
                            <p> I'm very keen on learning new languages and I'm currently learning korean. </p>
                            <p> I do enjoy - maybe more than I should - developing design projects such as this website, but due to university I don't update it so frequently and I also have the feeling I don't have much to put in here right now :/ </p>
