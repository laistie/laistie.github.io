                            <p> The main purpose of this website is to develop my coding skills, although its content, as for now, won't be focused on formal projects; but if you want to check some of my university projects, you should take a look at my github profile, which is linked down below the socials section, or directly <a href="https://github.com/laistie/uni-projects" target="_blank" rel="next">here</a>. </p>
                        <h2> <mark> a little about me </mark> </h2>
                            <p> I'm a 4th semester undergraduate student of computer science at Universidade Estadual de Londrina (UEL). Even though I've had lots of fun designing this website from scratch, I'm more interested in data science right now, especially after I've started using R in my Statistics' classes last semester. </p>
                            <p> In my spare time, I appreciate studing foreign languages - I'm currently learning mandarin - and I've been keen on games since I was little, so I usually spend lots of time playing cozy games, such as Stardew Valley, and some competitive ones, like Valorant, with my friends.</p>
