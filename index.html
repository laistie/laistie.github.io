                            <p> The main purpose of this website is to develop my coding skills, although its content, as for now, won't be focused on formal projects; but if you want to check some of my university projects, you should take a look at my github profile, which is linked down below the socials section, or directly <a href="https://github.com/laistie/uni-projects" target="_blank" rel="next">here</a>. </p>
                        <h2> <mark> a little about me </mark> </h2>
                            <p> I'm a 3rd semester undergraduate student at Universidade Estadual de Londrina (UEL). </p>
                            <p> I'm very keen on learning new languages and I'm currently learning mandarin. </p>
                            <p> I've had lots of fun designing this website, but I'm more interested in data science right now. </p>
