A lot has happened since the last time I wrote here, but I'll not go through details to most part of it; rn, I'd like only to add a disclaimer to the 1st short I've written here: today, I hate Sundays - but there're days that I still like them.</p>

                    <p class="short-text"> Uni semester's finally over and it's my 1st week in SP. I arrived two days ago and I'm trying to spend some quality time with my family, especially with Nina, she's the one I miss the most when I'm away. Also, I'm taking some time off to set up some goals, since this semester wasn't so great for me. I hope this time I'll be spending here helps me somehow. </p>

                    <p class="short-text"> I've been into skincare recently, doing a lot of research of products and all that stuff, which I've never thought I'd do; but I went through some hard times recently and I guess it's been my way of rebonding with myself. In other words, I think being able to assign some time of the day to take care of myself, by my own, has been really helpful so I don't burnout from uni and life in general. Well, maybe we all need some "skincare" in our routine, even if it only consists in wearing some sunscreen. </p>

                    <p class="short-text"> I've been trying to rebond with one of my hobbies these days - since I have plenty of time bc I'm not havin uni classes rn -, so I'm currently reading Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas, even though it's so difficult to understand. I'm enjoying it and somehow reading Machado de Assis brings me back to highschool days. I guess part of me will always miss that. </p>

                    <p class="short-text"> Every time I go out when I'm at SP, I wonder if Nina thinks that I'm leaving for an indefinite time; she prob does n that makes me kinda sad. The idea of being left will always be painful for me, I guess. </p>

                    <p class="short-text"> Today I rewatched Lady and The Tramp, which I haven't watched since I was a kid. God knows how much I love that movie; it's probably one of my favourites from Disney. If I were to make a tier list, it'd certainly contain Lady and The Tramp, 101 Dalmatians and Zootopia :) </p>

                    <p class="short-text"> La La Land is probably one of my favourite films; I remember fallin sleep when I watched it for the very 1st time, right after it was released. Although I didn't pay much attention on the story at that time, after rewatching it, it took a soft spot on my heart. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZAw8qxn0ZE" target="_blank" rel="external"> City of Stars </a> is indeed a masterpiece. </p>

Well, there's no point brooding over that rn. </p>

                    <p class="short-text"> "(...) at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then." <br> That's a quote from Alice in Wonderland, probably one of my favourites. We're used to dealing with major changes that happen in our life, but we usually don't think abt how different we are comparing to the person we were when we woke up; mayb that's why we deal so bad with changes in general: we don't even deal with the little ones through the day, how could we possibly deal with the life-changing ones? </p>

                    <p class="short-text"> Oficially my very first short; I dunno about what I'll be writing here and with which frequency, but for now I'd just like to state that Sundays are so peaceful I've begun to like them. I remember that it used to be my least favourite day of the week bc there's always a Monday right after it, but isn't it so superficial not enjoying a whole day due to the day that comes after it? I mean, I could list many things I appreciate doing on Sundays, like taking a walk with Nina in the morning and stopping by the street fair to order a pastel or taking my own time to do my stuff n not having to worry about things I'd usually think of during the week. Anyways, I've begun to like Sundays.</p>
