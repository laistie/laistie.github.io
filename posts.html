                    <p class="short-text"> Oficially my very first short; I dunno about what I'll be writing here and with which frequency, but for now I'd just like to state that Sundays are so peaceful I've begun to like them. I remember that it used to be my least favourite day of the week bc there's always a Monday right after it, but isn't it so superficial not enjoying a whole day due to the day that comes after it? I mean, I could list many things I appreciate doing on Sundays, like taking a walk with Nina in the morning and stopping by the street fair to order a pastel or taking my own time to do my stuff n not having to worry about things I'd usually think of during the week. Anyways, I've begun to like Sundays.</p>
