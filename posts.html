                    <p class="short-text"> La La Land is probably one of my favourite films; I remember fallin sleep when I watched it for the very 1st time, right after it was released. Although I didn't pay much attention on the story at that time, after rewatching it, it took a soft spot on my heart. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZAw8qxn0ZE" target="_blank" rel="external"> City of Stars </a> is indeed a masterpiece. </p>

                    <p class="short-text"> Time always flies when I'm at SP; I actually haven't done much during my stay besides spendin sum time w/ my family n watchin a kdrama - it's called Run On -, but I rly get the feeling that days passed by way too fast. Well, there's no point brooding over that rn. </p>

                    <p class="short-text"> "(...) at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then." <br> That's a quote from Alice in Wonderland, probably one of my favourites. We're used to dealing with major changes that happen in our life, but we usually don't think abt how different we are comparing to the person we were when we woke up; mayb that's why we deal so bad with changes in general: we don't even deal with the little ones through the day, how could we possibly deal with the life-changing ones? </p>

                    <p class="short-text"> Oficially my very first short; I dunno about what I'll be writing here and with which frequency, but for now I'd just like to state that Sundays are so peaceful I've begun to like them. I remember that it used to be my least favourite day of the week bc there's always a Monday right after it, but isn't it so superficial not enjoying a whole day due to the day that comes after it? I mean, I could list many things I appreciate doing on Sundays, like taking a walk with Nina in the morning and stopping by the street fair to order a pastel or taking my own time to do my stuff n not having to worry about things I'd usually think of during the week. Anyways, I've begun to like Sundays.</p>
